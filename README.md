# Weblog - blog app

A simple blog app created with Django, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, SQL and HTMX.

### Introduction
This blog site uses pagination on each view to limit the outputted data, and with the help of infinite scroll, the data outputted increases to as many pages as the user scrolls to. Instead of using the traditional category feature, Django Taggit was used. In all, this is a simple yet functional site.

### Technologies
The project was created with the following:

•	Python 3.11.0 <br/>
•	Django 4.2.1 <br/>
•	Django Templating <br/>
•	Bootstrap 4 <br/>
•	HTMX <br/>
•	CSS3 <br/>
•	HTML5 <br/>
•	SQLite3 <br/>

### Setup
To run this project, install it locally using Python;
1.	python -m venv venv
2.	venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
3.	pip install -r requirements.txt
4.	python manage.py runserver

### Status
While I have completed this project, I intend to build it into a robust app by adding more features in the coming days.
